25 RGB LEDs or Q'doba? That is the question.
Arduinos are up and running -- Arduino's website also has scores of helpful example programs (ie fading with the PWM analog output pins, and even some serial port communication!).
We observed the programs supplied to us blink the LED at progressively faster pace, as well as take live user input from a Serial Monitor to the USB.
After some intense discussion, we decided that a $7 purchase of 25 RGB LEDs are absolutely essential to advance the progress of this team, whether they be included in our final product or demonstrations along the way.
