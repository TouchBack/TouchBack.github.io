title: Software Setup!
---

Today, Alex and I finished downloading and setting up the [Leap Motion SDK][leapsdk]. Kudos to the Leap team, because it was a surprisingly painless process!

Bolstered by our access and raring to get started, we perused the Leap Motion Python API website and found the "Setting Up a Project" page. Lo and behold...

Wouldn't it be grand if documentation were always complete?

Fortunately for us, the Python [Hello World][pythonhello] page contained the information we were looking for! Hooray!

We have stored the fruits of our labor in a [public Github repository][templaterepo]. This project contains the bare minimum required files to interface with the Leap Motion using Python. Double hooray!

Unfortunately, this project only accounts for Mac OS right now. We'll be updating it soon to work on Windows, as well.

The software team's homework for the week is to read the aforementioned [Hello World page][pythonhello], learn more about the [Leap Motion Python API bindings][pythonapi], and write our first Leap Motion app.

And finally, we decided on [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html) as our software license. We're glad to share all of our code and knowledge with everybody... as long as they're willing to do the same!

I'm getting really excited about this project!!
