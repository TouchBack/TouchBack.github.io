Went over goals for the weekend, planned out what we want to have before our meeting on Monday!

Elizabeth and I are going to learn about Arduino coding, how it can get input from the computer, and creating some diagrams to display. 

Andy and Alex are creating diagrams, demonstrating the Leap Motion API, and brainstorming a communications protocol for the haptic glove.
