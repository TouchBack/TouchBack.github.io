Resources
=========

Here we will gather a list of resources that we used during the development of TouchBack.

* [PyLeapMouse](https://github.com/openleap/PyLeapMouse/blob/master/Linux/Mouse.py) - Open source utility that binds LeapMotion movements and gestures to mouse commands. Not currently using code from this, but it could be a useful resource.

* [aJson](https://github.com/interactive-matter/aJson) - Open source JSON parsing library for Arduino. We may decide to use this to parse commands sent from the desktop application.
